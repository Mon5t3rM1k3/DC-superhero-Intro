            <p>Aquaman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris
                and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941).[1]. Initially a backup
                feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series.
                During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding
                member of the Justice League. In the 1990s Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman's character more
                seriously, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.[2]

                The son of a human lighthouse-keeper and the queen of Atlantis, Aquaman is the alias of Arthur Curry,
                who also goes by the Atlantean name Orin. Others to use the title of Aquaman include a short-lived human
                successor, Joseph Curry; his protégé Jackson Hyde; and the mysterious Adam Waterman, who was briefly
                active during World War II. Aquaman's comic books are filled with colourful undersea characters and a
                rich supporting cast, including his mentor Vulko, his powerful wife Mera, and various sidekicks such as
                Aqualad, Aquagirl, and Dolphin. Aquaman stories tend to blend high fantasy and science fiction. His
                villains include his archenemy Black Manta and his own half-brother Ocean Master, among others.</p>
