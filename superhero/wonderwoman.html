                <p>Wonder Woman is a superhero created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston
                    (pen name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter for DC Comics. Marston's wife, Elizabeth,
                    and their life partner, Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character's
                    appearance.

                    Wonder Woman appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is a founding
                    member of the Justice League. The character first appeared in All Star Comics #8 published October
                    21, 1941 with her first feature in Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942. The Wonder Woman title
                    has been published by DC Comics almost continuously ever since. In her homeland, the island
                    nation of Themyscira, her official title is Princess Diana of Themyscira. When blending into the
                    society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her civilian identity Diana Prince.

                    Wonder Woman's origin story (from Golden to Bronze Age) relates that she was sculpted from clay by
                    her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts
                    by the Greek gods. In 2011, DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the biological
                    daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe.
                    The character has changed in depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her powers
                    entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and
                    emphasized her Amazonian heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical items, including the
                    Lasso of Truth, a pair of indestructible bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in
                    older stories, a range of devices based on Amazon technology.</p>
