                <p>The Flash (Bartholomew Henry "Barry" Allen) is a superhero appearing in American comic books
                    published by DC Comics. He is the second character known as the Flash, following Jay Garrick. The
                    character first appeared in Showcase #4 (October 1956), created by writer Robert Kanigher and
                    penciler Carmine Infantino.

                    Like other heroes who go by The Flash, Barry is a "speedster", with powers that derive mainly from
                    his superhuman speed. He wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind
                    resistance, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring. Originally created as a
                    reimagining of the popular 1940s superhero The Flash (Jay Garrick), the success of the Barry Allen's
                    Flash comic book helped to bring about the Silver Age of Comic Books, and contributed to a large
                    growth in DC Comics' stable of science fiction comics and characters. During popular early volumes
                    as the Flash, Barry established his own Rogues Gallery of colourful villains and sci-fi concepts
                    like the Speed Force. Through crossovers with popular characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and
                    Batman, Barry Allen's Flash also helped establish DC's flagship Justice League title, whose success
                    would define its publishing strategy for decades to come.</p>
