                <p>Green Lantern is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC
                    Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all
                    of which come from imagination, fearlessness, and the electromagnetic spectrum of emotional
                    willpower. The characters are typically depicted as members of the Green Lantern Corps, an
                    intergalactic law enforcement agency.

                    The first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell with scripting
                    or co-scripting of the first stories by Bill Finger during the Golden Age of Comic Books and
                    usually fought common criminals in Capitol City (and later, Gotham City) with the aid of his magic
                    ring. For the Silver Age of Comic Books, John Broome and Gil Kane reinvented the character as Hal
                    Jordan in 1959 and introduced the Green Lantern Corps, shifting the nature of the character from
                    fantasy to science fiction. During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams
                    introduced John Stewart, a new member of the Corps who was one of DC's first black superheroes.
                    Other notable Green Lanterns include Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz and Jo
                    Mullein.</p>
